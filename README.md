# Project-Innara
Hello everyone, 

Project Innara is a toy language/compiler project for my small microcontroller(EK-TM4C123GXL).
EK-TM4C123GXL is an ARM-Archititure microccontroller.  

initial project plan as of now:
  -> Compiles to small RISC STACK MACHINE, and run it on a virtual machine to avoid any hardware problems. Plus it's much easier to learn the theory that way :)
  -> Move The AST to RISC 32I
  -> lower it to LLVM
